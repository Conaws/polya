* Concept

Have you ever come across an interesting library and thought, "This looks cool, but when would I really use this?"

Have you ever thought that about a core function?

This wiki is based on a few premises

 * That we learn best when we're working through interesting problems
 * Big complex problems can often be "decomplected", or broken down into a collection of smaller sub problems
 * Once you've solved a small problem, its nice to see what other larger problems you've just gotten closer to solving
 * If you're going to invest a bunch of time in learning a concept, it is helpful to have some idea what it might be useful for
 * It can be really helpful to see what other approaches people have taken to solving the same problem

The goal of this wiki is to collect a bunch of sample problems for learning various libraries, patterns, and idioms in the Clojure language. 

Ideally, each library would have a section of their wiki dedicated to posting challenge problems and user submitted solutions, but for now, we can start by posting them here.

When you find a problem you have solved, consider putting your solution in a Gist, and posting a link here
the number of lines of code in your solution

Links should have the following format 

Name, Lines of Code, Number of Libraries
